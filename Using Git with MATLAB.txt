1) cygwin
2) add path
3) token

rec:
1) git for windows
    default option, but recommend Notepad++
2) ssh-keygen, enter 3x
Note path to id_rsa.pub
3) git = settings().matlab.sourcecontrol.git;
git.KeyHasPassphrase.PersonalValue = true;
4) Copy id_rsa.pub contents, github upper right -> settings
5) Make sure to remember token

MATLAB version 2021a or later is strongly recommended.

This is an involved process, follow carefully

A) Install software and dependencies:
1) Create an account at github.com
                                2) Install GitHub application from
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
3) Windows: install cygwin:
    https://cygwin.com/install.html
        ALL PACKAGES?
4) Configure the path to cygwin.
        cd(prefdir)
        edit javalibrarypath.txt
    Add on a blank line the path to cygwin
        Default: C:\cygwin64\bin\
5) Restart Matlab

B) Link GitHub and MATLAB
1) Open GitHub CMD, type
    ssh-keygen
    Hit Enter 3 times. This will create a file with the default name
        id_rsa.pub
2) Open the .pub file this creates in a TEXT EDITOR ("Open with...")
   It can be found by typing in MATLAB:
        Windows: getenv('USERPROFILE')
        Mac/Linux: getenv('HOME')
   From there, navigate 1 directory down to \.ssh\ folder. Open the .pub file
3) Copy the entire contents of the file. It should be 1 line starting with:
    "ssh-rsa"
4) Go to github.com, log in, and click your icon in the upper right then "Settings"
5) In the "SSH and GPG keys" tab on left, click "New SSH key". Give it a title
    and paste the .pub contents. Finish adding it.

In GitHub, go to your profile icon in upper right > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
Create a new one and then SAVE THE RESULTING KEY. This is your "password" in MATLAB.

C) Connect this particular project

1) Download project from https://github.com/sfoneil/ColorConversions
    Click the green button with "Code" and "Download ZIP" from dropdown.
    Extract the .zip to a folder of your choice.
 start with ssh-rsa
3) In Matlab, open NewColorConversions.prj
